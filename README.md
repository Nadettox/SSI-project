# SSI-project

These days, a lot of applications ask for an ID and a password. When drowning under too many passwords, we are most likely to forget them.

Considering this, the project is supposed to be useful for everyone.
In the end, this github repository will contain a *password vault* allowing to create a random password linked to a user ID.

We will be happy to see you propose solutions to make this project better.
